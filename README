I am doing problems following the order.
This is also a place I wanna mark for the second round.

mark
(1c) complete in 1st round
(1c - m) has special comment need to pay attention

(1c) Search a 2D Matrix
(1c) Search for a Range
(1c) Search in Rotated Sorted Array
(1c - m) Sqrt(x)  -- need think about methods except Binary Search. Many options
 
 Sequence
 
(1c) Container With Most Water
(1c) Count and Say
(1c - m) First Missing Positive -- need more practice and understanding
(unfinisheg skipped)Implement strStr() -- KMP took me too many time... next time maybe my mind could be clearer...

(1c -m)Two Sum know Arrays.sort() in Java using dual pivot quicksort. review quicksort and dual quicksort in utility package
3Sum
( -m)3Sum Closest Binary Search only can garuantee that it find the index, if there are duplicates, it's not necesarrily which one among it. To find the range, try to do Binary search twice, find the first and the last one. That also means it's possible to find the first one by keep checking whether its left value is equals to target
